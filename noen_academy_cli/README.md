# Task

Welcome to the Neon Academy, where we unlock the potential of brilliant minds and turn them into world-class Flutter developers. As a member of our elite team of Academy members, you have been chosen to participate in a special challenge that will test your skills and determine if you have what it takes to become a full-fledged member of the academy.

The challenge is to create a model for our academy members, called the NeonAcademyMember. This model will be used to keep track of all the members in our academy, and it must include the following properties:

- fullName: The member's full name.

- title: The member's title or position within the academy.

- horoscope: The member's astrological sign.

- memberLevel: The member's level of membership within the academy.

- homeTown: The member's hometown.

- age: The member's age.

- contactInformation: An instance of a separate class, called ContactInformation, which will include the following properties


    - phoneNumber: The member's phone number.


    - email: The member's email address.

You may be wondering why the horoscope property is included in the model. In the Neon Academy, we believe that everyone is unique and special in their own way, just like the stars in the sky. And just as the stars align to create a unique constellation, we believe that each member's unique qualities align to create a powerful team.

To complete this challenge, you will need to create an instance of the NeonAcademyMember class for all members of your team, and add them to an array. Additionally, you will need to create an instance of the ContactInformation class for each member and link it to their corresponding NeonAcademyMember instance.

This challenge is not only a test of your skills but also a test of your creativity. The best solution will be used to keep track of all members in our academy, and will be admired and studied by future generations of developers. So, be creative and make it epic!

Please submit your solution, including a playground file containing your code, to the item. Good luck and may the stars align in your favor!
